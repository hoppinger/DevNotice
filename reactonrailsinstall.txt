rails new rordemo --webpack=react
rails generate react_on_rails:install
bundle install

We did not find a spec/rails_helper.rb or spec/spec_helper.rb to add
the React on Rails Test helper, which ensures that if we are running
js tests, then we are using latest webpack assets. You can later add
this to your rspec config:

# This will use the defaults of :js and :server_rendering meta tags
ReactOnRails::TestHelper.configure_rspec_to_compile_assets(config)


What to do next:

  - Include your webpack assets to your application layout. Change hello-world-bundle as needed.

      <%= javascript_pack_tag 'hello-world-bundle' %>

  - Run the foreman command to start the rails server and run webpack in watch mode.

      foreman start -f Procfile.dev

  - Change this line app/views/hello_world/index.html.erb to `prerender: true` to see
    server rendering (right click on page and select "view source").

      <%= react_component("HelloWorldApp", props: @hello_world_props, prerender: true) %>

  - Run the foreman command to start the rails server and run webpack in HMR mode. Be sure
    to change your development/dev_server/hmr setting to true to see HMR in action.
    Note, you cannot use the default Procfile.dev-server setup with server rendering.

      foreman start -f Procfile.dev-server

  - You may run the commands in the Procfiles in separate shells rather than using foreman.

  - See the documentation on https://github.com/rails/webpacker/blob/master/docs/webpack.md
    for how to customize the default webpack configuration.

  - Visit http://localhost:3000/hello_world and see your React On Rails app running!
